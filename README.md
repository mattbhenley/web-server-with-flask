The web server will be able to react to the user inputting dynamic content, turning your website into a web application capable of doing more than just showing static information.

##Build a Flask website

We need to make sure we have python3 installed. https://www.python.org/downloads/

We also need to install Flask with pip. 
```sudo pip3 install flask```
